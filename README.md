Code repository for the manuscript: Dynamic Regulation of JAK-STAT Signaling Through the Prolactin Receptor Predicted by Computational Modeling 

The most important two files (driver.m and core_file.m) are placed in the main directory of the repository. driver.. contains the code to simulate the predicted concentration of all molecular species by solving the differential equations contained in core_file.m.

The R and Matlab directories contain subdirectories which contain all of the necessary code (.R or .m files) to reproduce any of the findings and figures from the paper. The basic organizational structure is
- data: contains the data inputs to run a particular analysis
- output: an example output of the analysis
